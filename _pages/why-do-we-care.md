Active biopolymers matter because they are the physical machinery of life. Cells move, divide, sense, and organize themselves using polymer networks that consume energy.

This page can explain why this topic is important for:

- Fundamental physics: nonequilibrium systems, self-organization, and emergent behavior.
- Biology: cell mechanics, transport, shape change, and development.
- Materials science: designing adaptive and responsive soft materials.
- Medicine: understanding disease states linked to cytoskeletal and biomolecular mechanics.

Use this section as a plain-language bridge between your technical work and broader impact.
